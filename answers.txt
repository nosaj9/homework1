What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
A merge will create a new commit that is from combining both branches together and will preserve the history and the previous work. Whereas rebase will actually overwrite all the commit history as if they were taken from the tip of the other branch, destroying the original.

What is a remote repository?
A remote repository is a repository in a remote location that can be accessed with an internet connection. This is normally where multiple people push their code for a project so it can be retrieved by different people, which allows each person to work on separate parts of a project.
